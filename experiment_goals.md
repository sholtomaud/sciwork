# Scientific Workflow Experiment: Validation of the Odum Energy Systems Model

## Aims and Goals
The primary goal of this study is to rigorously validate a computational model of an Odum Energy System. We aim to determine the model's accuracy, reliability, and predictive power under various conditions. The study will assess how well the model's predictions of energy storage levels align with synthetic observational data, representing scenarios where the model is expected to perform well, poorly, and marginally.

## High-Level Methodology
The experiment will proceed in two main phases.

### Phase 1: Pre-Experiment Analysis and Report Generation
An LLM will be used to generate the initial sections of a scientific report based on this document. This includes a detailed abstract, an introduction to Odum energy systems and the importance of model validation, a formal hypothesis statement with clearly defined independent and dependent variables, and a comprehensive methods section.

**Independent Variable:** The primary independent variable is the energy flow input over time into the system.
**Dependent Variable:** The primary dependent variable is the energy level within the model's storage compartment (Q) over time.

### Phase 2: Simulation, Validation, and Interpretation
1.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** Three sets of synthetic 'observed' data will be generated to represent different validation scenarios: 'support' (high model accuracy), 'fail' (low model accuracy), and 'marginal' (mediocre model accuracy).
2.  **Model Simulation:** The Odum Energy System model will be run using the same energy input flows that generated the synthetic data.
3.  **Statistical Analysis:** A comprehensive suite of statistical tests will be used to compare the model's predictions against the synthetic observations for each of the three cases. This includes RMSE, MAE, Pearson correlation, and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE).
4.  **LLM Interpretation:** The statistical results from each test case will be sent to an LLM. The LLM will interpret these results to generate the 'Results', 'Discussion', and 'Conclusion' sections of the scientific report, providing a narrative explanation of the model's performance in each scenario.
5.  **Final Report:** All generated text, data, and plots will be compiled into a single, comprehensive scientific report in DOCX format.
